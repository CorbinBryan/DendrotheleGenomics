# An Introduction to Genomic Analysis 
This repository is intended to serve as a robust introduction to the theory and praxis required for genomic analysis. In recent years, increased availability of publicly available genomes has coinsided with a corresponding increase in the prevalence and number of genomic studies which do not unilaterally reflect what "best practices" of genomic analysis. The softwares and algorithms required for genomic analysis are not magic spells that automatically produce the best results but must be optimized for a given dataset by modulating program parameters. 

In the documents herein, you will find a comprehensive tutorial on methods of genome quality control and assembly. Additionally, analytical tools for genomics and their downstream applications are discussed to provide contextual information about the scope and feasibility of genomic various downstream experiments. Along the way, you will learn the fundamental computational skills of the modern bioinformatician. This crash course in genomics and bioinformatics is intended to empower researchers new to working with genomes with the knowledge-base they need to develop robust hypotheses and experiments with genomic data.
